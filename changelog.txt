Changes (AMongeMoreno): 

	// DONE 

	- Created 2 management commands to sync (update all instances of registered models) and 
	clean (remove all seo paths for instances of registered models)
	- Extended DEFAULT_SEO_TITLE to DEFAULT_SEO_TITLES to allow specifying a different
	fallback title for each language (also for DEFAULT_SEO_DESCRIPTION). The fallback language is
	'en', english if not specified otherwise by LANGUAGE attribute in settings.
	- DEFAULT_SEO_TITLES and DEFAULT_SEO_DESCRIPTIONS can also be specifyed at model level, allowing
	to specify a common base title and description for all instances of this model (on each language as well)
	- Reset SEO (add is_default to the model to indicate if its the default value or something modified)

	

	// TO DOC

	- Title and description for registered seo models can include variables taken from the instance.
	- Title and description variables that have language alternatives must check for them before fallbacking to default one.
